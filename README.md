I have been to a few weddings this year and every one had a problem getting a hashtag Instagram feed going. Because of this, I decided to create a solution for my own upcomming wedding. The app can be used as a photobooth on one device while the photos are shown on another device (iPad or TV).

This is the first draft of the app with fixes and features still to come.

Features:
- send photos from one device to another. no messy wires, no expensive fees, just free and simple
- No internet required; uses multipeer connectivity (Bluetooth 4.0 required)
- Draw on photos before you send
- add filters to photos before you send
- no hassle setup
- written purely in swift #DoYouEvenSwiftBro
